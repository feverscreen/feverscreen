# Sometimes when changing channels the latest version in the new channel you are on will have an older semantic version causing apt not to install be default
# Adding this in /etc/apt/preferences.d/ will mean that when changing channels the latest software from that channel will now be installed when running apt upgrade
# More info can be found from looking at `apt-cache policy feverscreen` and `man apt_preferences`
