# FeverScreen

FeverScreen uses a FLIR Lepton 3 camera to detect people who may have
a raised temperature in a quick and contactless way.

It is based on code from the Cacophony Project, in particular
[thermal-recorder](https://github.com/TheCacophonyProject/thermal-recorder/)
and
[management-interface](https://github.com/TheCacophonyProject/management-interface/).
